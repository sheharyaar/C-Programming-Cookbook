# C Programming Cookbook

Contains short notes on certain C programming tips.

## Books

- **Pointers on C - Kenneth A. Reek** <p>
The book is old but it sure is gold. I can recommend this book at any moment of my programming life. As the name suggests it does make you fluent with pointers so that you don't avoid them. It not only helps you understand C but also clearly mentions various **tips** and **cautions** where people generally perform errors or ignore important things which makes the code buggy. It covers most of the parts required to start an intermediate level of C including introduction to Signals, IPC, IO, etc. 
	
- **Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets - Peter van der Linden** <p>
	This books needs no introduction as it has established itself a gem in C Programming
